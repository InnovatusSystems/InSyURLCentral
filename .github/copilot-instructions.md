This project is an ASP.NET Core web application (Razor Pages) with a single-page control panel UI. The backend serves a list of URLs from appsettings.json via a controller. The frontend is a PWA with manifest.json, install prompt handling, and standalone launch mode. Prioritize clean separation of backend and frontend logic, and follow best practices for PWA and ASP.NET Core development.
